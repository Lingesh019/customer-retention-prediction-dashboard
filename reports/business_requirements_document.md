## 6. Business Rules & Logic

### 6.1 Churn Definition
A customer is considered "churned" if:
- Account closed voluntarily by customer
- Service discontinued after 60+ days of non-payment
- Contract not renewed after expiration (for fixed-term contracts)

### 6.2 Risk Scoring Logic
- **High Risk (70%+):** Immediate intervention required within 48 hours
- **Medium Risk (30-70%):** Targeted campaign within 1 week
- **Low Risk (<30%):** Include in general retention programs

### 6.3 Campaign Trigger Rules
- New customers (tenure < 6 months) with satisfaction < 6: Welcome program
- High-value customers with increasing support calls: Premium retention
- Contract expiring within 60 days: Renewal campaign
- Payment method issues: Payment assistance program
